                <h4>The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett</h4>
                <p style="padding-left: 60%;">
                    The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical. But after growing up together in a small, southern
                    black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that
                    is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities.
                    Many years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried
                    to escape. The other secretly passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past.
                    Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain
                    intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters' storylines
                    intersect?
